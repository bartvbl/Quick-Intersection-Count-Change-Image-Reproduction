# Source code repository for the paper "Radial Intersection Count Image: a Clutter Resistant Shape Descriptor"

This repository contains:

- A reference implementation of the Radial Intersection Count Image
- Efficient GPU implementations of the Spin Image and 3D Shape Context descriptors
- A reference implementation of the Clutterbox Experiment
- A script which can be used to completely reproduce all results presented in the paper

## Instructions

You can run the start the script by running:

```bash

python3 replicate.py

```

From the root of the repository.

Refer to the included Manual PDF for further instructions.
